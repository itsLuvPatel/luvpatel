        <h3 id="p">  Hello and welcome to my website! My name is Luv and I'm a 20-year-old student based in Pune.
          I created this website as a way to share my experiences and showcase my skills. As a student,
          I'm constantly learning and exploring new topics,
          and I decided to learn HTML as a way to develop my web development skills and build something that I could be proud of.
          When I'm not studying or coding,
          I enjoy bike rides. Through this website, I hope to connect with others who share my passions and interests,
          and I'm excited to share my journey with you. Thanks for visiting!
